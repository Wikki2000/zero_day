### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight, plain-text formatting syntax that can be easily converted into HTML. It was created to simplify writing for the web and is widely used for writing documentation, README files, blogs, and more.
## Basic Syntax
### Headers

You can create headers by using the `#` symbol followed by a space. The number of `#` symbols indicates the header level (from 1 to 6).

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```
### Emphasis
Emphasize text using * or _ for italics and ** or __ for bold.
```markdown
1. *italic* or _italic_
2. **bold** or __bold__
``````
### Lists
Create ordered and unordered lists with 1., -, or *.
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
- Unordered item 1
- Unordered item 2
``````
### Links

Create links using [link text](URL).
```markdown
[Google](https://www.google.com/)
Advanced Usage
Images
Embed images using ![alt text](URL).
``````
## Advance usage
### Images
Embed images using :
```markdown
![Image Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
``````
### Code Blocks
Insert code blocks using triple backticks (```) with optional language specifier.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
``````
### Tables

Create tables using pipes `|` and hyphens `-` for headers.

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Row 2    |
``````
### Additional Tips
```markdown
Escape special Markdown characters with a backslash (\) if you want to display them as regular text.
Use > for blockquotes.
Horizontal rules can be added with three hyphens (---) or three asterisks (***).
```mark down is use to enter block quote and (```) is use to escaple code block.
